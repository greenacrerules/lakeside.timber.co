                        <p>
                               At <strong>'Lakeside Timber Co.'</strong>, craftsmanship runs deep in our roots. 
                               Founded on a passion for fine woodworking and expert design, we are dedicated to creating custom-built spaces that seamlessly blend beauty, 
                               functionality, and longevity.

                        <p>
                              Born and raised on <strong>Vancouver Island, British Columbia</strong>, I've had a passion for woodworking for as long as I can remember. 
                              From a young age, I was drawn to the art of building—fascinated by the way raw materials could be transformed into something both functional and beautiful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              I began my career as a labourer and carpenter's helper in my late teens, working across various <strong>construction and millwork shops</strong> to gain hands-on experience. 
                              By the age of 24, I fully stepped into my role as a carpenter and have dedicated myself to honing my craft ever since. 
                              With years of experience in both structural and fine woodworking, I bring a deep understanding of materials, design, and technique to every project.
                        </p>
